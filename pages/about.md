## About the Collection

The collection consists of 37 plans, surveys or maps of the City of Niagara Falls, Ontario, beginning in 1832 until 1928. The plans show the various developments in Niagara Falls duirng a time of significant growth including subdivisions, railways, and bridges.   

Some of the plans were created for the City of the Falls Company.  The Company was owned by a group of successful and influential men in Upper Canada who proposed a real estate venture on land near the Falls.  The Company's shareholders included James Buchanan, the Honourable William Allan, the Honourable John Henry Dunn, Thomas Dixon, Lieutenant General John Murrary, James Robinson, Samuel Street Jr., and Thomas Clark.  They envisioned a residential development that would be designed to help preserve the natural beauty of the area.  However, sales were slow and the development of steam railways on the American side brought less traffic to the area.  The company did not have sufficient funds to see the project through and the propsoed development never materialized.  Although the project ultimatley failed, the streets in the area still bear the names of the project's shareholders.
