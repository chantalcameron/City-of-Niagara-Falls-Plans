## About the Collection

The collection consists of 37 plans, surveys or maps of the City of Niagara Falls beginning in 1832 until 1928. Some of the plans were created for the Falls Company, a group of land speculators that included Buchanan, Murray, Street, Allen, Robinson and others. Other plans relate to the building of the suspension bridge and the railway.
